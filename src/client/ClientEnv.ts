/**
 * No server is known: the API's list has not loaded (or carries none for
 * this build) and the page itself names none either.
 *
 * Raised by numWorkers() and propagated by every accessor that derives a
 * worker route from it — workerIndex(), workerPath(), and gameWorkerPath()
 * on its own-server branch. Those have no truthful answer without a server:
 * a worker count belongs to ONE server, so any number routes to a worker
 * that does not own the game. (gamePath() is the deliberate exception: it
 * catches this and falls back to the worker-free `/game/<id>` shape.)
 *
 * serverWsBase() / serverHttpBase() raise it too, but only on a page that
 * names no server of its own. On a dev box, on a standalone deployment and
 * on any server-rendered page the document's origin IS the game server, so
 * those keep the same-origin answer they have always had (ownServerKnown).
 * The static page the site Worker serves is the one case where the origin is
 * nobody: it is the page host, which runs no game server, so a socket built
 * from it hangs for the edge's origin-connect timeout and then fails. Failing
 * at URL-build time instead is what routes it into the path below.
 *
 * Typed so callers can tell "there is no server" from a programming error and
 * route it into the connection-failed path they already have
 * (LobbySocket.handleConnectError, createLobby's callers) rather than letting
 * it surface as an uncaught exception.

 * Where a link meant to LEAVE this client should point.
 *
 * On the web that is the document's own origin: the page the copier is looking
 * at is the page the recipient should get.
 *
 * The desktop shell is the exception, and the reason this exists. It serves the
 * renderer from its own privileged scheme — `app://openfront/index.html` — so a
 * link built from `window.location` reads
 * `app://openfront/index.html#modal=profile&publicID=…`, which resolves to
 * nothing anywhere except inside that one Electron app. It is not even a link
 * the desktop client itself can take back: the friends box only unwraps http(s)
 * URLs. So the shell's links go to siteOrigin() — the website it was downloaded
 * from (openfront.io in prod, a branch subdomain on staging) — with the same
 * audience fallback desktopWebAccountSettingsUrl in Auth.ts already used for
 * this question, localhost dev port included, for a shell that injects neither
 * host.
 *
 * Keyed on the document's scheme rather than on siteOrigin's presence, because
 * the `app:` scheme is itself what makes a link unshareable, and because a
 * server-rendered web page is a site in its own right: whatever host the copier
 * is reading right now is a host their recipient can open. (A desktop build
 * pointed at a local dev server with OPENFRONT_DEV_URL is on http and gets the
 * web answer for exactly that reason.)
