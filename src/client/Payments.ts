 * Note what this deliberately does NOT check: whether Steam is actually
 * running, or whether the shell is new enough to carry the microtxn bridge.
 * `preload.ts` exposes the `steam` namespace unconditionally, so this is
 * true of every desktop build, Steam running or not.
 *
 * That is the right answer rather than a shortcut. The desktop build must
 * never reach Stripe — `navigationPolicy.ts` refuses payment-origin link-outs
 * — so falling back to "stripe" here would hand back a `redirectUrl` the
 * shell then blocks, which is a dead button and a support ticket. Choosing
 * "steam" instead fails honestly: without a Steam session the server answers
 * `provider_account_required`, which tells the player to sign in again. And
 * on a shell too old to have the bridge, the checkout still succeeds and the
 * overlay dialog still appears (the server raises it, not us) — the purchase
 * simply settles via the poll loop instead of our finalize call, which is
 * exactly what `startPurchase` reports as pending.
